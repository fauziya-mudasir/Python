Time Tracker project.
This project seeks to document/track the number of hours worked and the amount of money earned.
It requires the user to enter the start time and date as well as the end time and date he/she started working.
The difference is computed to get the total number of hours worked.
The user is again requested to enter his/her rate(hourly wage).
The product of the total number of hours worked and rate is computed to arrive at the amount of money earned.
